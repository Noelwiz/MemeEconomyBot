Goals for this rewrite

[ ]Decouple the Discord stuff from the game logic

[ ]Fix outstanding bugs
  - selling
  - leader board order

[ ]Change from a player controlled round system*
  *I still want to leave the round system for a potential single player non-discord version of the bot*

[ ]compile an executable that can run the bot easily
(note, currently waiting on the seperating discord and game logic
  so i can make a nice .exe file)
